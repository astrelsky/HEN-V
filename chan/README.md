chan
====

Pure C implementation of Go channels.

## Unbuffered Channels

Unbuffered channels provide both a mechanism for communication as well as synchronization. When data is sent into the channel, the sender blocks until a receiver is ready. Likewise, a receiver will block until a sender is ready.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "chan.h"

chan_t* chan;

void* ping()
{
    // Send blocks until receiver is ready.
    chan_send(chan, "ping");
    return NULL;
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize unbuffered channel.
    chan = chan_init(0);

    pthread_t th;
    pthread_create(&th, NULL, ping, NULL);

    // Receive blocks until sender is ready.
    void* msg;
    chan_recv(chan, &msg);
    printf("%s\n", msg);

    // Clean up channel.
    chan_dispose(chan);
}
```

With an unbuffered channel, the sender and receiver are synchronized, so the above program will print `ping`.

## Buffered Channels

Buffered channels accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values. Sending data will not block unless the channel is full. Receiving data will block only if the channel is empty.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "chan.h"

int main()
{
    // Initialize buffered channel with a capacity of 2.
    chan_t* chan = chan_init(2);

    // Send up to 2 values without receiver.
    chan_send(chan, "buffered");
    chan_send(chan, "channel");

    // Later receive the values.
    void* msg;
    chan_recv(chan, &msg);
    printf("%s\n", msg);

    chan_recv(chan, &msg);
    printf("%s\n", msg);

    // Clean up channel.
    chan_dispose(chan);
}
```

The above program will print `buffered` and then `channel`. The sends do not block because the channel has a capacity of 2. Sending more after that would block until values were received.

## Closing Channels

When a channel is closed, no more values can be sent on it. Receiving on a closed channel will return an indication code that the channel has been closed. This can be useful to communicate completion to the channelâ€™s receivers. If the closed channel is buffered, values will be received on it until empty.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "chan.h"

chan_t* jobs;
chan_t* done;

void* worker()
{
    // Process jobs until channel is closed.
    void* job;
    while (chan_recv(jobs, &job) == 0)
    {
        printf("received job %d\n", (int) job);
    }

    // Notify that all jobs were received.
    printf("received all jobs\n");
    chan_send(done, "1");
    return NULL;
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize channels.
    jobs = chan_init(5);
    done = chan_init(0);

    pthread_t th;
    pthread_create(&th, NULL, worker, NULL);

    // Send 3 jobs over the jobs channel then close it.
    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
    {
        chan_send(jobs, (void*) (uintptr_t) i);
        printf("sent job %d\n", i);
    }
    chan_close(jobs);
    printf("sent all jobs\n");

    // Wait for all jobs to be received.
    chan_recv(done, NULL);

    // Clean up channels.
    chan_dispose(jobs);
    chan_dispose(done);
}
```

This program will print:

```
sent job 1
received job 1
sent job 2
received job 2
sent job 3
received job 3
sent all jobs
received all jobs
```

## Select Statements

Select statements choose which of a set of possible send or receive operations will proceed. They also provide a way to perform non-blocking sends and receives. Selects are particularly useful for multiplexing communication over several channels.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "chan.h"

chan_t* messages;
chan_t* signals;

int main()
{
    // Initialize channels.
    messages = chan_init(0);
    signals = chan_init(0);
    void *msg;

    // This is a non-blocking receive. If a value is available on messages,
    // select will take the messages (0) case with that value. If not, it will
    // immediately take the default case.
    switch(chan_select(&messages, 1, &msg, NULL, 0, NULL))
    {
        case 0:
            printf("received message %s\n", msg);
            break;
        default:
            printf("no message received\n");
    }

    // A non-blocking send works similarly.
    msg = "foo";
    switch(chan_select(NULL, 0, NULL, &messages, 1, &msg))
    {
        case 0:
            printf("sent message %s\n", msg);
            break;
        default:
            printf("no message sent\n");
    }

    // We can use multiple cases above the default clause to implement a
    // multi-way non-blocking select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives on
    // both messages and signals.
    chan_t* chans[2] = {messages, signals};
    switch(chan_select(chans, 2, &msg, NULL, 0, NULL))
    {
        case 0:
            printf("received message %s\n", msg);
            break;
        case 1:
            printf("received signal %s\n", msg);
            break;
        default:
            printf("no activity\n");
    }

    // Clean up channels.
    chan_dispose(messages);
    chan_dispose(signals);
}
```

This program will print:

```
no message received
no message sent
no activity
```
